# Manufacturing-Analytics-Dashboard
Manufacturing Analytics Dashboard is an interactive data visualization tool designed to monitor and analyze key manufacturing KPIs. It provides real-time insights into production performance, rejection trends, wastage, and employee efficiency.
# 🏭 Manufacturing Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
Manufacturers face challenges in tracking **production efficiency**, identifying **rejection causes**, and reducing **wastage**.  
This project analyzes manufacturing KPIs such as **orders, processed quantity, rejected quantity, wastage %, and employee/machine efficiency** to provide actionable insights that support better **decision-making and operational improvements**.

- 📊 Dashboards built in **Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**  
- 🎯 Focus on **production performance, machine efficiency, and rejection trends**  
- 🏭 Covers **department, buyer, and employee-level insights**

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** → Pivot tables, KPI cards, slicers, and interactive dashboards  
- **Power BI** → Advanced visuals, quarterly slicers, KPI tracking  
- **Tableau** → Drill-down dashboards, machine-level analysis, and trend monitoring
